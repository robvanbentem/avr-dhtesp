ATMEGA328p dual DHT22 sensor reporting to external data collector and grapher using ESP8266

Code is messy but thats ok I guess since it's just a proof of concept/learning experience.

This piece of code contains a basic implementation of the DHT22/DHT11 protocol. No extensive error detection is done (no checksum validation).

Comms. to ESP are done using basic AT commands.
